## Primary Pages

| Page                   | Description                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View  | Grid display of available properties with filters                |
| Listing Detailed View  | Complete property details with images and booking form           |

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the server-side logic, APIs, and integrations. They ensure the application performs efficiently and securely.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database schema and ensures data integrity, performance, and backup strategies.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up and manages CI/CD pipelines, containerization (e.g., Docker), and deployment environments.

### Security Analyst
Implements authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and vulnerability prevention measures across the backend system.

### Project Manager
Coordinates the team, defines goals, manages timelines, and ensures that the team adheres to Agile or similar workflows.

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Django** | High-level Python web framework for rapid backend development and RESTful API creation. |
| **MySQL**  | Relational database used for persistent data storage such as users, properties, bookings, and reviews. |
| **GraphQL** | Provides a flexible API layer for querying and mutating data more efficiently than traditional REST. |
| **Docker** | Containerization platform to ensure consistent development and production environments. |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD automation tool used to run tests, lint code, and deploy the app. |
| **Nginx** | Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer to improve performance and scalability. |

## Database Design

### Key Entities

- **User**
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
  - Relationships: Can own properties, make bookings, and leave reviews.

- **Property**
  - Fields: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `location`
  - Relationships: Belongs to a user (owner), has many bookings and reviews.

- **Booking**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`
  - Relationships: Belongs to a user and a property.

- **Review**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - Relationships: Created by a user for a property.

- **Payment**
  - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `timestamp`
  - Relationships: Linked to a specific booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Handles user registration, login/logout, and profile updates. Ensures secure access and role-based permissions.

### Property Management
Allows property owners to list, update, and delete properties with images, descriptions, and availability dates.

### Booking System
Enables users to search, filter, and book available properties. Includes booking validation and conflict checking.

### Reviews and Ratings
Permits users to leave feedback and ratings for properties they have booked, improving trust and transparency.

### Payment Integration
Supports secure processing of payments tied to bookings. May include refund functionality and invoice generation.

## API Security

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints, implemented via JWT or OAuth.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control to limit certain actions (e.g., only owners can edit their listings).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse by restricting the number of requests from a client within a timeframe.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Protects against SQL injection and XSS by validating and cleaning user inputs.
- **HTTPS/SSL**: Encrypts data transmission to ensure confidentiality and integrity of user data.

**Why It Matters**:
- **User Data**: Protects sensitive user information such as passwords and payment data.
- **Business Logic**: Prevents malicious users from exploiting business processes.
- **Legal Compliance**: Helps adhere to privacy laws like GDPR.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Overview

CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying software.

### Benefits

- Reduces human error during deployment.
- Speeds up the development lifecycle.
- Encourages frequent, reliable updates with minimal downtime.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates tasks like code linting, testing, and deployment on push/merge.
- **Docker**: Packages the app with all dependencies for consistency across environments.
- **Nginx + Gunicorn**: Deployment stack for serving the Django application efficiently.
